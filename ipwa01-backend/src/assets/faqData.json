      "title": "What is CO2 Emission and why is it so harmfull?",
      "answer": "CO2 emissions, primarily generated by the burning of fossil fuels in industries, transportation, and energy production, are a significant contributor to global climate change and environmental degradation. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a greenhouse gas that traps heat in the Earth's atmosphere, leading to a rise in global temperatures, a phenomenon known as global warming. This warming effect disrupts weather patterns, intensifies storms, accelerates polar ice melt and sea-level rise, and endangers biodiversity and ecosystems. Additionally, elevated CO2 levels can have direct detrimental effects on human health, causing respiratory issues and exacerbating conditions like asthma. The harmful impacts of CO2 emissions highlight the urgent need to transition to sustainable, low-carbon alternatives and reduce our reliance on fossil fuels to mitigate the severe consequences of climate change."
